An Open Source Rap/R&amp;B Song About Bitcoin

I’ve been wanting to write a song about Bitcoin for some time now.  Seeing how Bitcoin is a decentralized open source payment network. Why not make an Open Sourced song about it?

The song should be both positive and uplifting. Let’s talk about the benefits of having a decentralized currency. 

The song will have three 16 bar verses with a chorus after each verse. As of right now I’m basing the song of this rhythm and tempo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev0iaiZP58g. 

Every line should be equal to a half-bar. That makes two lines a bar. So 1 verse will be 32 lines.

The Final song will have an instrumental created specifically for it. Tony Satori will be recording the song in a professional studio. 

If you are interested in what Tony Satori sounds like he has a reverb nation page. http://www.reverbnation.com/tonysatoriakasatorit

The completed song will be completely free to download and disseminate without restriction.
