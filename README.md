An Open Source Rap/R&amp;B Song About Bitcoin

I’ve been wanting to write a song about Bitcoin for some time now.  Seeing how Bitcoin is a decentralized open source payment network. Why now make an Open Sourced song about it?

The song will have three 16 bar verses with a chorus after each verse. As of right now I’m basing the song off of this rhythm and tempo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev0iaiZP58g. 

The Final song will have an instrumental created specifically for it. My brother will be recording the song in a proffessional studio. 

If you are interested in what he sounds like he has a reverb nation page. http://www.reverbnation.com/tonysatoriakasatorit
